1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Databases to display a list of your DB instances.
3. Choose the name of the MySQL DB instance to display its details.
4.On the Connectivity & security tab, copy the endpoint. Also, note the port number.
You need both the endpoint and the port number to connect to the DB instance.
5. If you need to find the master user name, choose the Configuration tab and view the Master username value.

Connecting from the MySQL client:
mysql -h [DNS name/endpoint] -P [port] -u [aws db username] -p [aws db password]
